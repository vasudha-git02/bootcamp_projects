## bootcamp_projects
Welcome to my Bootcamp Projects repository! This collection includes various projects I completed during my data analytics and data science bootcamp. Each project helped me build foundational skills in Python, SQL, data manipulation, and visualization.

## How to Use This Repository
Each project has its own folder containing:
Code: The Python scripts or notebooks used for the project.
Data: Sample data or links to datasets (when possible).
README: An individual README file with project details, goals, and steps.
